# Linear-Regression-Model-BoomBike


Background
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
Mostly bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Problem Definition :
 - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Covid pandemic and finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.

 - The Company has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state

 BoomBikes wants to understand various factors that can increase bike demands post pandemic and would like to prepare business strategy.
 - The major parameters that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
 - How well those variables describe the bike demands


Buisness Goal:
 - Develop a model to predict the variables which are significant for the demand of shared bikes with the available independent variables.
 - To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how effectively these variables can predict bike demands.
 - These variables will be used by the company to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
